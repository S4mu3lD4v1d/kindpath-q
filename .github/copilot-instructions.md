You are working in the KindPath Q repo.

Obey:
- Desktop-first macOS (Monterey compatible, Intel).
- Standalone + plugin architecture planned from outset.
- Mono-safe analysis + club translation focus.
- Teach psychoacoustic/psychosomatic mapping + music history snippets.

Rules:
- No giant frameworks unless requested.
- Prefer C++20 + CMake or JUCE if chosen.
- Every feature includes docs in /docs and a minimal test or validation note.
- No placeholders in shipping code. If incomplete, mark clearly and stub safely.

Deliver:
- Small incremental PR-sized changes.
- Clear file paths and commands to build/run.
