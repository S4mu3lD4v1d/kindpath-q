# KindPath Q Architecture

## Modules
- `core/analysis`: FFT spectrum, RMS/loudness, crest factor, correlation, transient density, and feel tags.
- `core/dsp`: Small DSP utilities (mono collapse).
- `core/education`: Education card data loader and model.
- `ui`: Shared JUCE components (transport bar, waveform, analysis panel, education panel, main layout).
- `apps/standalone`: JUCE standalone app using the shared UI and analysis engine.
- `plugins/kindpath-q`: JUCE plugin (AU/VST3) using the same analysis engine and UI shell.
- `scripts`: Bootstrap and build helpers.
- `assets`: Visual and audio assets (placeholders now).

## Data Flow
- Audio comes from the standalone transport source or plugin input bus.
- `AnalysisEngine` runs per block and stores a snapshot (spectrum, RMS, crest, correlation, transient density).
- UI polls snapshots on a timer and renders meters + spectrum bars.
- Education cards are loaded from JSON and rotated on user interaction.

## Shared Boundaries
- `AnalysisEngine` is shared across app and plugin.
- UI is shared and wired to analysis + education data in each target.
