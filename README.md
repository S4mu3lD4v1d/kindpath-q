# KindPath Q

KindPath Q is a desktop-first standalone + plugin (AU/VST3) music assistant focused on analysis, mix coaching, and teachable “why it feels good” guidance.

## Status
Scaffolding: repo structure + build system baseline.

## Goals
- Standalone app + plugin from the outset (macOS first).
- Mono-safe analysis + club-ready translation focus.
- Teach foundations + psychoacoustic “feel” in plain language.

## Dev
See /docs.
